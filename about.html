			<p>We hope you'll take time to get acquainted with us by reading the brief bios on this page. After reading our stories, please contact us if we can help you in your church planting journey, or if you have questions about how you can connect with Grace Global Network.</p>
			<h2>WHAT IS GRACE GLOBAL NETWORK?</h2>
			<p>Grace Global Network is a ministry dedicated to locating, training, connecting, resourcing, and multiplying healthy movements of new church planting around the world.</p>
			<p>We are working to build a network of synergistic, evangelical church planting movements of reproducing churches, who will partner with others in multiplying a million plus churches around the globe. We do this, not by providing all the answers ourselves, but by connecting innovative leaders with other innovative leaders, and helping church planters to adopt the kinds of thought processes that support effective church planting.</p>
			<p>All of this rests on a solid committment to Jesus Christ, and to the Word of God, as our foundation for ministry.</p>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>WHAT DOES GGN DO?</h2>
			<p>GGN initiates opportunities for church movement leaders to network, strategize, share innovations, and form partnerships for ministry. We do this through Church Planter's Summits, missions trips, training church planters, training and mentoring movement leaders, writing materials, and conducting worshops and seminars.</p>

			<h2>WHY SHOULD YOU GET INVOLVED IN GGN?</h2>
			<p>If you've read this far, you probably have more than a passing interest in seeing the Gospel shared around the world. After all, that's one mark of a healthy Christian. Another mark of a healthy faith is that you're interested in finding ways you can take action to make a difference in your world. A difference that reaches beyond your own front door.</p>
			<p>We'd like to challenge you to learn more about GGN and prayerfully consider what God would have you do to support Grace Global Network. We're currently looking to sign up hundreds people who will pray for this ministry once a week. We'd consider it an honor to have you take up this challenge! After you read and pray about GGN, if you would like to sign up for our prayer partners list, please send an email to Dr. Greg Kappas ...we're looking forward to hearing from you soon!</p>

			<h2>About Dr. Greg Kappas<span>President of Grace Global Network</span><span>greg@graceglobalnetwork.org</span></h2>
			<p>Dr. Greg Kappas has coached over 200 leaders in starting hundreds of multiplying, reproductive churches around the globe since 1991. He emphasizes the need for each church planter and their team to view their new work in the Gospel as a church planting center reproducing around the globe. He stresses the need for the church to be multi-ethnic, cross-cultural and multi-generational.</p>
			<p>Greg co-authored Twenty-Five Questions for Planting a Healthy Church, a popular and extensive CD/Workbook resource for church planters. This resource is used around the world and provides church planters with everything from teaching on the church planting process, to templates and materials you can adapt to your local church planting project. Greg also co-authored the book Somewhere Inside the Rainbow, a primer on the what, why, and how of developing dynamic churches that intentionally combine Biblical, multi-ethnic, cross-cultural and multi-generational values.</p>
